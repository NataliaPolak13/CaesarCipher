# CaesarCipher

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher in C#. The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features

- Encrypts text using a Caesar Cipher with a specified shift key.
- Decrypts ciphertext using the provided key.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Non-alphabetic characters (such as digits and punctuation) remain unchanged.

## Requirements

- .NET Framework or .NET Core (depending on the version used in the project).
- A development environment such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NataliaPolak13/CaesarCipher.git
2. Open the project in your preferred development environment.
3. Build the project.
4. Run the application.

## How to Use
Upon running the application, you will be prompted to:
1. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
2. Enter the shift key (an integer).
3. Choose the operation: encryption or decryption.

The application will display the result in the console.
